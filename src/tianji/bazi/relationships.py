"""
刑冲合害 (Branch Relationships) analysis for BaZi.

This module analyzes interactions between earthly branches in a chart:
- 六合 (Six Harmonies): Two branches combine
- 三合 (Three Harmonies): Three branches form a strong element
- 六冲 (Six Conflicts): Two branches oppose each other
- 三刑 (Three Punishments): Two or three branches punish each other
- 六害 (Six Harms): Two branches harm each other
- 自刑 (Self-Punishment): Same branch duplicated
